# Text-Sentiment-Analysis

This assignment performs text sentiment analysis to study the public opinion on Tweeter about the 2015 Canadian Federal Election and the correlation with the final election results. Code is divided into five sections: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model preparation, model implementation, and discussion.

Note: <br/>
The three text files used ( unclassified_tweets.txt , classified_tweets.txt and stop_words.txt ) should be in the same directory as this IPython script.
